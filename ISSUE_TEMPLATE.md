**Issue tracking is moving to the [DCOS JIRA](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/) ([dcos-docs component](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DCOS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20dcos-docs)).
Issues on Github will be disabled soon, but can't be disabled until existing ones are migrated. So please make a JIRA issue instead!**
