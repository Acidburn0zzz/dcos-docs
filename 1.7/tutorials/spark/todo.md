Scala, POM, S3

https://github.com/mesosphere/time-series-demo/tree/master/stream-processing (simple batch, read CSV from S3)

## Spark and Storage

Install HDFS (we need 5 nodes)

Handle HDFS via Hue:

https://github.com/mesosphere/multiverse/tree/version-2.x/repo/packages/H/hue/0


Upload file via Hue

Show a HDFS read from Spark

See also time series demo for writing to/reading from other storage systems (Kafka, S3, etc.)
