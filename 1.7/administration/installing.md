DC/OS can be installed on any cluster of physical or virtual machines.

# Local Installation

For first-time users or developers looking to build services or modify DC/OS, the [Vagrant installer][1] provides a quick, free way to deploy a virtual cluster on a single machine.

# Cloud Provisioning

For users deploying to the public cloud, DC/OS offers configurable [cloud provisioning templates][2] for AWS and Azure that will manage virtual machines and DC/OS installation.

# Datacenter Installation

For new users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premise or in the cloud, the [Automated Installer][3] provides a guided experience for bootstrapping a DCOS cluster.

For advanced users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premise or in the cloud, the [Manual Installer][4] provides a scriptable, automatable interface to integrate with your preferred configuration management system.
