# Contributing to the DC/OS Documentation

If you want to contribute some documentation, please do the following:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo.
1. Create a new directory in the appropriate location. For example, if it's a tutorial, create a new directory `foo/` in the `tutorials/` directory.
1. Copy the appropriate template for your content. For example, if it's a tutorial you can copy [templates/tutorial.md](templates/tutorial.md) into `foo/` and rename it to `README.md`
1. Adapt the sections in your new `foo/README.md` to the specifics of your content.
1. If you have screen shots, you can store them in `foo/img/`.
1. When you're done, make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the original repo.

Note that if you're unsure about what exactly should go into the tutorial, you can always check out [spark/](../1.7/tutorials/spark/) for reference.
