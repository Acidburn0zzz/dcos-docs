Uninstalling DC/OS on Azure involves deleting the Azure resources used in its deployment.

If you deployed the DC/OS cluster into a **new resource group**, all you have to do is delete that resource group.

If you deployed the DC/OS cluster into an **existing resource group**, you'll need to individually identify and delete all resources that belong to the DC/OS cluster.
