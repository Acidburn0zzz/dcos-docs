You can create a DC/OS cluster for Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the DC/OS templates on AWS CloudFormation.

## Basic templates

The [basic templates](/docs/1.10/installing/cloud-templates/aws/basic/) provide:

* Limited customization options
* Fastest deployment and minimal setup required
* Great for simple production deployments, demos, and testing

## Advanced templates

The [Advanced templates](/docs/1.10/installing/cloud-templates/aws/advanced/) allow customization of the AMI, VPC, and Instance Types. The advanced templates are:

* Highly customizable
* Composable, for example you can deploy multiple agent pools to a single cluster
* More setup work is required
