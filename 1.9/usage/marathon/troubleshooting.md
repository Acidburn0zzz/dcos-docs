There are several reasons why your service may fail to deploy. Some possibilities include:

- Marathon isn't getting the resource offers it needs to launch the app.
  Use the [CLI](/docs/1.9/usage/debugging/cli-debugging) or the [debugging page in the DC/OS web interface](/docs/1.9/usage/debugging/gui-debugging) to troubleshoot unmatched or unaccepted resource offers from Mesos. You can also [consult the service and task logs](/docs/1.9/administration/logging/).

- The service's health check is failing.
  If a service has a health check, deployment does not complete until the health check passes. You can see the health of a service with Marathon health checks from [the DC/OS web interface](/docs/1.9/usage/debugging/gui-debugging). To see more information about the health of a service with Marathon health checks, run `dcos marathon app list --json` from the DC/OS CLI.

- `docker pull` is failing.
  If your app runs in a Docker image, the Mesos agent node will first have to pull the Docker image. If this fails, your app could get stuck in a "deploying" state. The Mesos agent logs (`<dcos-url>/mesos/#/agents/`) will contain this information.

<!-- app definition is otherwise badly configured... messages from the UI, docs, messages from the CLI... what else? Hausenblas' script? -->
