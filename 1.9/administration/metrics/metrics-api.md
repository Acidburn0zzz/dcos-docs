You can use your custom built tools to get any metric, either from running Mesos tasks or the hosts which run your DC/OS cluster. 

The HTTP producer is enabled by default and exposes a JSON-formatted HTTP API on each node in the cluster. These APIs include both metrics datapoints as well as dimensions, or key/value pairs with relevant node and cluster metadata.
