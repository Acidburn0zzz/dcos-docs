You can create scheduled jobs in DC/OS without installing a separate service. You can creat and administer jobs in the DC/OS web interface, the DC/OS CLI, or via an API.

**Note:** In the web interface DC/OS Jobs functionality is sometimes referred to as ["Metronome,"](https://github.com/dcos/metronome) the name of the open source Mesos framework for jobs that comes preinstalled with DC/OS.

## Functionality

You can create a job as a single command you include when you create the job, or you can point to a Docker image.

When you create your job, you can specify:

* The amount of CPU your job will consume.

* The amount of memory youd job will consume.

* The disk space your job will consume.

* The schedule for your job, in chron format. You can also set the time zone and starting deadline.

* An arbitrary number of labels to attach to your job.

* Permissions for your job.
