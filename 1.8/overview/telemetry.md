To continuously improve the DC/OS experience, we have included a telemetry component that reports anonymous usage data back to us. We use this data to monitor the reliability of core DC/OS components, installations, and to find out which features are most popular.
 
The anonymous usage information is sent back to us by the signal service (`dcos-signal.service`) queries the diagnostics service `/system/health/v1/report` endpoint on the leading master and sends this data to SegmentIO for use in tracking metrics and customer support.The signal service is the telemetry component.

The following information is collected.

# general

For each track (segment term), the data is the same:
"clusterId": "70b28f00-e38f-41b2-a723-aab344f535b9",
- the `anonymousID` we create for every cluster. created at startup. persists across cluster forever. 

"customerKey": "",
- Enterprise: this is set with the customer key that we give to you.

"environmentVersion": "",
- The version of DC/OS.

"provider": "aws",
- What platform DC/OS is running on: aws, on-prem, azure.

"source": "cluster",
- Hard-coded setting that indicates cluster.

"variant": "open"
- Either OSS or Enterprise

"anonymousId": "70b28f00-e38f-41b2-a723-aab344f535b9",
- an anonymous ID we create for every cluster. created at startup. persists across cluster forever.

"event": "package_list"
- name that appears in segment.io. cosmos, health, mesos_track.

# diagnostics

For every systemd unit, the following is collected:
```
"health-unit-dcos-<UNIT_NAME>-total": 3, "health-unit-dcos-<UNIT_NAME>-unhealthy": 0,
